Task 1
A Fibonacci series (starting from 1) written in order without any spaces in between, thus
producing a sequence of digits.
Write a Scala application to find the Nth digit in the sequence.
○ Write the function using standard for loop
○ Write the function using recursion

Task 2
Create a calculator to work with rational numbers.
Requirements:
○ It should provide capability to add, subtract, divide and multiply rational
numbers
○ Create a method to compute GCD (this will come in handy during operations on
rational)
Add option to work with whole numbers which are also rational numbers i.e. (n/1)
- achieve the above using auxiliary constructors
- enable method overloading to enable each function to work with numbers and rational.

Task 3
1.Write a simple program to show inheritance in scala.
2.Write a simple program to show multiple inheritance in scala.

3.Write a partial function to add three numbers in which one number is constant and two
numbers can be passed as inputs and define another method which can take the partial
function as input and squares the result.

4.Write a program to print the prices of 4 courses of Acadgild: Android-12999,Big Data
Development-17999,Big Data Development-17999,Spark-19999 using match and add a
default condition if the user enters any other course
